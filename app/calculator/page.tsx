              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Regular binding (also called straight-grain binding) is cut parallel to the selvage of the fabric. 
                This type of binding works well for quilts with straight edges and is the most common binding method.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-[#5D4037] mb-2">Bias Binding</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Bias binding is cut at a 45Â° angle to the selvage of the fabric. This gives the binding more 
                flexibility and stretch, making it ideal for quilts with curved edges. Bias binding is also more 
                durable as the bias cut distributes wear more evenly.
